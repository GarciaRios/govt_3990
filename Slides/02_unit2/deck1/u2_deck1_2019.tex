\label{mi1}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{1. Probability trees are useful for conditional probability calculations}

\begin{itemize}

\item Probability trees are useful for organizing information in conditional probability calculations

\item They're especially useful in cases where you know P(A $|$ B), along with some other information, and you're asked for P(B $|$ A)

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Bayesian inference: start with a prior, collect data, calculate posterior, make a decision or iterate}
\label{mi2}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{2. Bayesian inference: start with a prior, collect data, calculate posterior, make a decision or iterate}

\begin{itemize}[<+->]

\item In Bayesian inference, probabilities are at times interpreted as \textbf{degrees of belief}.

\item You start with a set of \textbf{prior beliefs} (or prior probabilities).

\item You observe some data.

\item Based on that data, you update your beliefs.  

\item These new beliefs are called \textbf{posterior beliefs} (or posterior probabilities), because they are \textbf{post}-data.

\item You can iterate this process.

\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Dice game}

We'll play a game to demonstrate this approach:

\begin{itemize}

\item Two dice: 6-sided and 12-sided
\begin{itemize}
\item I keep one die on my cellphone and one die on my computer
\end{itemize}

\pause

\item The ``good die'' is the 12-sided die.

\pause

\item Ultimate goal: come to a class consensus about whether the die on the cellphone or the die on the computer is the ``good die''

\pause

\item We will start with priors, collect data, and calculate posteriors, and make a decision or iterate until we're ready to make a decision

\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Prior probabilities}

\begin{itemize}

\item At each roll I tell you whether you won or not (win = $\ge 4$)
\begin{itemize}
\item P(win $\mid$ 6-sided die) = 0.5 $\rightarrow$ bad die
\item P(win $\mid$ 12-sided die) = 0.75 $\rightarrow$ good die
\end{itemize}

\pause

\item The two competing claims are
\begin{itemize}
\item[] $H_1$: Good die is on the cellphone 
\item[] $H_2$: Good die is on the computer
\end{itemize}

\pause

\item Since initially you have no idea which is true, you can assign equal \hl{prior probabilities} to the hypotheses
\begin{itemize}
\item[] P($H_1$ is true) = 0.5 
\item[] P($H_2$ is true) = 0.5 
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Rules of the game}

\begin{itemize}

\item You won't know which die I'm holding in which hand, left (Computer) or right (Cellphone). {\footnotesize left = YOUR left}

\item You pick die (L or R), I roll it, and I tell you if you win or not, where winning is getting a number $\ge$ 4. If you win, you get a piece of candy. If you lose, I get to keep the candy.

\item We'll play this multiple times with different contestants.

\item I will not swap the sides the dice are on at any point.

\item You get to pick how long you want play, but there are costs associated with playing longer.

\end{itemize}

At each trial you risk losing pieces of candy if you lose (the die comes up $<$ 4). Too many trials means you won't have much candy left. And if we spend too much class time and we may not get through all the material.
