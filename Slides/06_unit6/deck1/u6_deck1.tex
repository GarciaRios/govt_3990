\frametitle{Modeling numerical variables}

\begin{itemize}

\item So far we have worked with single numerical and categorical variables, and explored relationships between numerical and categorical, and two categorical variables.

\item In this unit we will learn to quantify the relationship between two numerical variables, as well as modeling numerical response variables using a numerical or categorical explanatory variable.

\item In the next unit we'll learn to model numerical variables using many explanatory variables at once.

\subsection{Least squares line minimizes squared residuals}
\label{mi2}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{(2) Least squares line minimizes squared residuals}

\begin{itemize}

\item Residuals are the leftovers from the model fit, and calculated as the difference between the observed and predicted $y$: $e_i = y_i - \hat{y}_i$

\item The least squares line minimizes squared residuals:
\begin{itemize}
\item Population data: $\hat{y} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x$
\item Sample data: $\hat{y} = b_0 + b_1 x$
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Interpreting the least squares line}
\label{mi3}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{(3) Interpreting the last squares line}

\begin{itemize}

\item \hl{Slope:} For each \underline{unit} increase in \underline{$x$}, \underline{$y$} is expected to be\underline{higher/lower} on average by \underline{the slope}.
\[ b_1 = \frac{s_y}{s_x} R \]

\item \hl{Intercept:} When \underline{$x = 0$}, \underline{$y$} is expected to equal \underline{the intercept}.
\[ b_0 = \bar{y} - b_1 \bar{x} \]
\begin{itemize}
\item The calculation of the intercept uses the fact the a regression line \textbf{always} passes through $(\bar{x},\bar{y})$.
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}

\vfill

\disc{Why does the regression line \textbf{always} pass through $(\bar{x},\bar{y})$?}

\pause

\begin{itemize}

\item If there is no relationship between $x$ and $y$ ($b_1 = 0$), the best guess for $\hat{y}$ for any value of $x$ is $\bar{y}$.

\item Even when there is a relationship between $x$ and $y$ ($b_1 \ne 0$), the best guess for $\hat{y}$ when $x = \bar{x}$ is still $\bar{y}$.
