\frametitle{2. T corrects for uncertainty introduced by plugging in $s$ for $\sigma$}

\begin{itemize}

\item CLT says $\bar{x} \sim N\left(mean = \mu, SE = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}\right)$, but, in practice, 
we use $s$ instead of $\sigma$.
\begin{itemize}
\item Plugging in an estimate introduces additional uncertainty.
\item We make up for this by using a more ``conservative" distribution than the normal distribution.
\end{itemize}

\pause

\item $t$-distribution also has a bell shape, but its tails are \hl{thicker} than the normal model's
\begin{itemize}
\item Observations are more likely to fall beyond two SDs from the mean than under the normal distribution.
\item Extra thick tails help mitigate the effect of a less reliable estimate for the standard 
error of the sampling distribution.
\end{itemize}

\item two (independent) samples: $df = min(n_1 - 1, n_2 - 1)$

Water samples collected at the same location, on the surface and in the bottom, cannot be assumed to be independent of each other, hence we need to use a \hl{paired} analysis.

For comparing average zinc concentration levels in the bottom and surface when the data are paired:

\pause

\begin{itemize}

\item \hl{Parameter of interest:} Average difference between the bottom and surface zinc measurements of \red{all} drinking water.
\[ \mu_{diff} \]

$\:$ \\

\pause

\item \hl{Point estimate:} Average difference between the bottom and surface zinc measurements of drinking water from the \red{sampled} locations.
\[ \bar{x}_{diff} \]

\frametitle{Parameter and point estimate for independent data}

For comparing average salaries in two independent groups

\pause

\begin{itemize}

\item \hl{Parameter of interest:} Average difference between the average salaries of \red{all} males and females in the US.
\[ \mu_m - \mu_f \]

$\:$ \\

\pause

\item \hl{Point estimate:} Average difference between the average salaries of \red{sampled} males and females in the US.
\[ \bar{x}_m - \bar{x}_f \]

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Standard errors}

\begin{itemize}

\item Dependent (paired) groups (e.g. pre/post weights of subjects in a weight loss study, twin studies, etc.)
\[ SE_{\bar{x}_{diff}} = \frac{s_{diff}}{\sqrt{n_{diff}}} \]

\item Independent groups (e.g. grades of students across two sections)
\[ SE_{\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2} = \sqrt{ \frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{s_2^2}{n_2} } \]

\item For the same data, $SE_{paired} < SE_{independent}$, so be careful about calling data paired
