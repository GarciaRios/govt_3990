\frametitle{Example - Breast Cancer \& Age}

{\small
It is theorized that an important risk factor for breast cancer is age at first birth. An international study was set up to test this hypothesis. Breast-cancer cases were identified among women in selected hospitals in the United States, Greece, Yugoslavia, Brazil, Taiwan, and Japan. Controls were chosen from women of comparable age who were in the hospital at the same time as the cases but who did not have breast cancer. All women were asked about their age at first birth.\\
~\\
The set of women with at least one birth was arbitrarily divided into two categories: (1) women whose age at first birth was less than or equal to 29 years and (2) women whose age at first birth was greater than of equal to 30 years. The following results were found among women with at least one birth: 683 of 3220 women with breast cancer (case women) and 1498 of 10,245 women without breast cancer (control women) had an age at first birth greater than or equal to 30. How can we assess whether this difference is significant or simply due to chance?\\
