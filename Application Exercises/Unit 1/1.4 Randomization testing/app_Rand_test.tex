Student-to-faculty ratio data collected from random samples of public and private four-year colleges:

\begin{minipage}[c]{0.4\textwidth}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lrrr}
  \hline
type & mean & SD & n \\ 
  \hline
private & 13.84 & 7.28 &  85 \\ 
  public & 17.60 & 4.57 &  57 \\ 
   \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}[c]{0.6\textwidth}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{ratio/ratio_box.pdf}
\end{center}
\end{minipage}


\begin{enumerate}

\item We would like to test if there is a \emph{difference} between the average student-to-faculty ratio between public and private four-year colleges using a randomization test. What are the hypotheses?

\soln{0.5cm}{$H_0: \mu_{public} = \mu_{private}$; $H_0: \mu_{public} \ne \mu_{private}$}

\item Fill in the blanks below for the appropriate set up for this test:

\begin{doublespace}
We write the student-to-faculty ratio of each public and private college in this sample on a total of \rule{2cm}{0.5pt} index cards. Then, we shuffle these cards and split them into two groups: one group of size \rule{2cm}{0.5pt} representing public colleges, and another group of size \rule{2cm}{0.5pt} representing private colleges. We calculate the difference between the average student-to-faculty ratios in the public and private colleges ($\bar{x}_{public} - \bar{x}_{private}$) and record this value. We repeat this many times to build a randomization distribution, which should be centered at \rule{2cm}{0.5pt} . Lastly, we calculate the p-value as the proportion of simulations where the simulated differences in means are \rule{5cm}{0.5pt}.
\end{doublespace}

\soln{0cm}{142, 57, 85, 0, -4 or less or 4 or more}

\item The dot plot below is created using 100 simulations. What is the p-value?

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{ratio/rand_dist_dot.pdf}
\end{center}

\soln{0.2cm}{Since only one observation is below -4 or above 4, p-value = 1 / 100 = 0.01.}

\item Based on the p-value, do these data provide convincing evidence to suggest that the student-to-faculty ratio in public four-year colleges is different than that of private four-year colleges.

\soln{1cm}{Yes, p-value is small (less than 0.05), hence we reject the null hypothesis. The data provide convincing evidence that the average student-to-faculty ratio is different for private and public colleges.}

\end{enumerate}
