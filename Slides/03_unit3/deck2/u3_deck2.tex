\frametitle{Announcements}

\begin{itemize}

\item Tips for project: be mindful of the two big deadlines, read over the assignment and start asking questions,
don't save the work till the last night -- this is not a project you can complete by pulling an all nighter

\item Peer eval feedback:
\begin{itemize}
\item Lateness / absence, mental presence, communication, commitment
\item Tips: Move seats around in class and lab, give your best, and don't assume the worst
\item Instructions: Give scores that reflect your verbal comments
\end{itemize}

\item Discussion section tomorrow: CLT, CIs, HTs

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Statistical inference methods based on the CLT depend on the same conditions as the CLT}
\label{mi1}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{1. Statistical inference methods based on the CLT depend on the same conditions as the CLT}

Always check these in context of the data and the research question!

\begin{enumerate}

\item \hlGr{Independence:} Sampled observations must be independent. \\
* This is difficult to verify, but is more likely if
\begin{itemize}
\item random sampling/assignment is used, and,
\item if sampling without replacement, $n$ $<$ 10\% of the population.
\end{itemize}

\item \hlGr{Sample size/skew:} Either the population distribution is normal or $n > 30$ and the population distribution is not extremely skewed (the more skewed the distribution, the higher $n$ necessary for the CLT to apply).\\
* This is also difficult to verify for the population, but we can check it using the sample data, and assume that the sample mirrors the population.

\end{enumerate}

\end{frame}

\subsection{Use confidence intervals to estimate population parameters}
\label{mi2}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{2. Use confidence intervals to estimate population parameters}

\vfill

\[ CI: point~estimate \pm margin~of~error \]
$\:$ \\

\pause

If the parameter of interest is the population mean, and the point estimate is the sample mean,
\[ \bar{x} \pm Z^\star \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} \]

\item $Z^\star = 1.65$

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Common misconceptions about confidence intervals}

\begin{enumerate}

\item \textcolor{gray}{The confidence level of a confidence interval is the
probability that the true population parameter is in the confidence
interval you construct for a single sample.} \\
\textit{The confidence level is equal to the proportion of random samples that result
in confidence intervals that contain the true pop.\ parameter.} \\

\pause

\item \textcolor{gray}{A narrower confidence interval is always better.}\\
\textit{This is incorrect since the width is a function of both the confidence level and 
the standard error.} \\

\pause

\item \textcolor{gray}{A wider interval means less confidence.} \\

\textit{This is incorrect since it is possible to make very precise statements with very 
little confidence.} \\

\end{enumerate}
 
\end{frame}

\subsection{Calculate the sample size a priori to achieve desired margin of error}
\label{mi4}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{4. Calculate the sample size a priori to achieve desired margin of error}

\vfill

\[ ME = z^\star \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} \]

So if we know the desired $ME$, and confidence level (and hence $z^\star$),
and the sample standard deviation, we can solve for $n$.
