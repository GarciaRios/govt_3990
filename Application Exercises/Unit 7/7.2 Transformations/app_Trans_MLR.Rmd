#### 1. Load data, and subset for those who were employed. Before you proceed, confirm that this leaves you with 787 observations.

```{r}
load(url("http://stat.duke.edu/~mc301/data/acs.RData"))
```

#### 2. Suppose we only want to consider the following explanatory variables: `hrs_work`, `race`, `age`, `gender`, `citizen`. Fit the full model using only the explanatory variables listed above, and report its adjusted $R^2$. Remember your response variable is `log(income)`, not `income`. 

```{r}

```

#### 3. Conduct model selection using the backwards adjusted $R^2$ method, and report the adjusted $R^2$ for the final model.

```{r}

```

#### 4. Check diagnostics for your final model using appropriate plots.

```{r}

```


#### 5. Interpret the slope for one numerical and one categorical predictor.

```{r}

```
