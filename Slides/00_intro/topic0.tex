Any form of academic dishonesty will result in an immediate 0 on the given assignment 
and will be reported to the Office of Academic Integrity. Additional penalties may also 
be assessed if deemed appropriate. If you have any questions about whether something 
is or is not allowed, ask me beforehand.

\frametitle{Tips for success}

{\footnotesize
\begin{itemize}[<alert@+>]
\item Complete the reading before a new unit begins, and then review again after the 
unit is over.
\item Be an active participant during lectures and labs.
\item Ask questions - during class or office hours, or by email. Ask me, and 
your classmates.
\item Do the problem sets - start early and make sure you attempt and understand all 
questions.

\item Start your project early and and allow adequate time to complete them.
\item Give yourself plenty of time time to prepare a good cheat sheet for exams. This 
requires going through the material and taking the time to review the concepts that 
you're not comfortable with.
\item Do not procrastinate - don't let a unit go by with unanswered questions as it 
will just make the following unit's material even more difficult to follow. 
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame} {The \emph{Challenger} launch decision}

Why didn't NASA make the right decision? \pause

Many answers in the literature:  \\
bureaucratic politics; group think; bounded rationality, etc \pause

But Edward Tufte thinks it may have been a matter of presentation \& modeling: \pause

\begin{itemize}
\item Never made the right tables or graphics

\item Selected only failure data

\item Never considered a simple statistical model
\end{itemize}
What do you think?  How would you approach the data?

Imagine you are the analyst making the launch recommendation.

You've made the scatterplot above.  What would you add to it?

Put another way, what do you is the first question you expect from your boss? \pause

``What's the chance of failure at 26 $^{\circ}$F?'' \pause

The scatterplot suggests the answer is ``high'', but that's vague \pause

But what if the next launch is at 58 $^{\circ}$F?  Or 67 $^{\circ}$F? \pause

Clearly, we want a more precise way to state the probability of failure

We need a \textit{model}, and a way to convey that model to the public.}

Model the probability of O-ring damage as a function of temperature

We can use a statistical tool called ``logit'' for this purpose

In a hearing, Richard Feynmann dramatically showed O-rings lose resilence when cold by dropping one in his ice water.

Experiment cut thru weeks of technical gibberish concealing flaws in the O-ring

But it shouldn't have taken a Nobel laureate: \\ 
any scientist with a year of statistical training could have used the launch record to reach the same conclusion

And it would take no more than a single graphic to show the result
