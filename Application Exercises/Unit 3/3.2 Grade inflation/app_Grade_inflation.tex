In 2001 the average GPA of students at Duke University was 3.37. Last semester 63 Sta 101 
students responded to the question on GPA on the class survey. The mean was 3.58, and the 
standard deviation 0.53. A histogram of the data is shown below.

Assuming that this sample is random and representative of all Duke students (bit of a leap 
of faith? you can discuss that when checking the conditions), do these data provide 
convincing evidence that the average GPA of Duke students has \textbf{\underline{changed}} 
over the last decade and a half?

Make sure to check conditions, note any assumptions you make, and show all your work.

Conditions:
\begin{itemize}
\item The sample is less than 10\% of the population of all Duke students, however it is not random.
It may not be reasonable to assume that the GPAs of sampled Duke students are independent
of each other.
\item The distribution is not extremely skewed, and the sample size is sufficiently large, to yield a nearly
normal sampling distribution of the mean.
\end{itemize}
\[ Z = \frac{3.58 - 3.37}{0.53 / \sqrt{63}} = 3.15 \rightarrow p-value = 0.0016 \]
