The following histogram shows the distribution of RottenTomatoes scores of a random sample of 54 comedies. 
The average score is 52.52 (out of 100).

The dot plot below shows the distribution of 200 bootstrap means calculated based on this sample. The bootstrap 
standard error is 1.98.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Describe in detail how this bootstrap distribution is constructed, outlining each step.

\soln{5cm}{
\begin{enumerate}
\item Take a random sample of size 54, with replacement, from the original sample.
\item Find the mean of this sample, and record it.
\item Repeat steps 1 and 2 200 times.
\end{enumerate}
}

\item Construct a 95\% bootstrap interval for the average RottenTomatoes score of comedies, using both 
methods and interpret them.

\soln{5cm}{
Percentile: Count 5 dots from each end -- roughly (49 - 56.8) \\
SE: $52.52 \pm 2.01 \times 1.98 \approx (48.5, 56.5)$ \\
We are 95\% confident that the average RT score of comedies is in these intervals.
}

\item Describe the differences and similarities between bootstrap and sampling distributions.

\soln{5cm}{
Similarity: Sample with replacement, sample size equal to original sample size. \\
Difference: Sampling dist constructed sampling from the pop, boot dist constructed sampling from the sample.
}

\end{enumerate}
