\subsection{Sample statistics vary from sample to sample}
\label{mi1}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Sample statistics vary from sample to sample}

\begin{itemize}

\item We are often interested in \hl{population parameters}.

\item Since complete populations are difficult (or impossible) to collect data on, we use \hl{sample statistics} as \hl{point estimates} for the unknown population parameters of interest.

\item Sample statistics vary from sample to sample.

\item Quantifying how sample statistics vary provides a way to estimate the \hl{margin of error} associated with our point estimate.

\item But before we get to quantifying the variability among samples, let's try to understand how and why point estimates vary from sample to sample.

\end{itemize}

\disc{Suppose we randomly sample 1,000 adults from each state in the US. Would you expect the sample means of their ages to be the same, somewhat different, or very different?}

\end{frame}

\disc{We would like to estimate the average number of drinks it takes students to get drunk. 
\begin{itemize}
\item We will assume that our population is comprised of 146 students.
\item Assume also that we don't have the resources to collect data from all 146, so we will take a sample of size $n = 10$. 
\end{itemize}
If we randomly select observations from this data set, which values are most likely to be selected, which are least likely?}

\subsection{CLT describes the shape, center, and spread of sampling distributions}
\label{mi2}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{2. CLT describes the shape, center, and spread of sampling distributions}

\emph{Under the right conditions}, the distribution of the sample means is well
approximated by a normal distribution:
\[ \bar{x} \sim N \pr{ mean = \mu, SE = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} } \]
A cheat: If $\sigma$ is unknown, use $s$.

\pause

\begin{itemize}

\item So it wasn't a coincidence that the sampling distributions we saw earlier were symmetric.

\item We won't go into the proving why $SE =  \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$, but note that as $n$ increases $SE$ decreases. 

\item As the sample size increases we would expect samples to yield more consistent sample means, hence the variability among the sample means would be lower.

\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{CLT only applies when independence and sample size/skew conditions are met}
\label{mi3}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{3. CLT only applies when independence and sample size/skew conditions are met}

\begin{enumerate}

\item \hlGr{Independence:} Sampled observations must be independent. \\

$\:$ \\
This is difficult to verify, but is more likely if
\begin{itemize}
\item random sampling/assignment is used, and,
\item if sampling without replacement, $n$ $<$ 10\% of the population.
\end{itemize}

\pause

\item \hlGr{Sample size/skew:} Either 

\begin{itemize}
\item the population distribution is normal or
\item $n > 30$ and the population dist.\ is not extremely skewed, or
\item $n >> 30$ (approx.\ gets better as $n$ increases).
\end{itemize}

This is also difficult to verify for the population, but we can check it using the sample data, and assume that the sample mirrors the population.

\end{enumerate}

In order to calculate $P(\bar{X} > 1.4~mil)$, we need to first determine the distribution of $\bar{X}$. According to the CLT,

\pause

\[ \bar{X} \pause \sim N \pause \left( mean = 1.3, \pause SE = \frac{0.3}{\sqrt{60}} = 0.0387 \right) \]

\pause

\begin{eqnarray*}
P(\bar{X} > 1.4 ) &=& P\left(Z > \frac{1.4 - 1.3}{0.0387}\right) \\
\pause
&=& P(Z > 2.58) \\
\pause
&=& 1 - 0.9951 \pause =  0.0049
