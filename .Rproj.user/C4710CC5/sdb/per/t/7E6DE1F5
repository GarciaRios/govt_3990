You are encouraged to use literate programming tools such as R Markdown and knitr.\n\n\n\n\n\n### Main Text\n\nYour final paper should be between 8 - 12 pages  all text (the abstract is text), tables and figures, notes, and references included in the manuscript.\nFont size must be a standard 12 point serif font.\nThe manuscript must be double spaced for all body text including the references, but text in tables and figures may be single spaced. Page margins must be one inch.\n\nThe submission must include a title page with the title of the paper, the author's name, date, an abstract of no more than 150 words.\nThe abstract should concisely state the literature to which the paper contributes, the specific topic it addresses, the methodology employed for the analysis, the results of the analysis, and the implications of the findings.\n\nThe manuscript should present its content as efficiently as possible. You do not need to include a literature review; state the research puzzle, your theory, and how it compares to previous approaches.\nCite the directly relevant works where necessary to support your argument.\n\n### Numbers, Tables, and Figures\n\nTables and figures should be included where they fall in the text, and not in an appendix. Tables and figures should be formatted for publication.\nIn particular do not use the direct simple output of R. And, of course **do not** take screen-shots of the output. Rather, use packages like `starazer`, `pander`, `kable`, `xtable`. At the minimum *if* you end up copy-pasting the simple output make sure to clean it up and format it on the paper. The tables  should be clear, readable, and easily understandable. \n\nDo not use acronyms or computational abbreviations when discussing variables in the text.\nAll variables that appear in tables or figures should be described in appropriate detail in the text. That is, do not use variable names, which only you will understand. For example, instead of using `V23TH` which was used to describe gender  in the original data-set use the name `Female` which would be understandable even if the reader has never looked at the code-book. \n\n\nYou are encouraged to use graphics to illustrate your main argument and research findings. If color is used, then it should be used appropriately, following the  best practices in data visualization. Make sure to label everything appropriately. Do not leave variables names or part of the coding. For example, legends that read `factor(V95M61)` should be coded properly beforehand so that the legend in the graph is simply `Level of Eduction` \n\nNumbers used in the manuscript text, figures, and tables should be reported with no more precision than they are measured with or is substantively meaningful.\nA good rule of thumb is to use no more than 2 digits unless there is good reason to do so.\nDo not report more significant digits than the standard errors imply.\nVariables should be scaled to make the reporting of results as straightforward as possible.\n\nThe uncertainty of estimates is best conveyed by standard errors or confidence intervals.\nGenerally, tables should not routinely report t-statistics or p-values for tests of the null hypothesis that each coefficient is zero\nRegression tables should report the estimate and standard errors of the coefficients, without stars indicating significance levels.\nWhile discouraged, it is acceptable to use asterisks, \"stars\", or other symbols to represent varying levels of statistical significance.\n\n\n### Footnotes\n\nExplanatory footnotes may be included but should not be used for simple citations.\nSimple citations should be made in-line in author-year format.\nDo not use end notes.\n\n### Citations and References\n\nReferences should be listed in a separate section titled \"References.\"\nCitations should be in the author-year format, and references can  follow your formats of preference, Chicago, MLA, APA, are some common styles used in the science sciences.\n\n### Data citation\n\nAll data used in the paper must be cited.\nCitations must include enough information for readers to find the original sources, and for those original sources to be consistently identified in the future.\nData citations should appear in the the manuscript's reference list.\n",
