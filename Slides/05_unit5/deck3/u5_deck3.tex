\subsection{Categorical data: 2 levels $\rightarrow$ Z, $>$2 levels $\rightarrow$ $\chi^2$ square}
\label{mi1}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Inference for categorical data}

\textbf{If sample size related conditions are met:}

\pause

\begin{itemize}

\item Categorical data with 2 levels $\rightarrow$ Z

\pause

\begin{itemize}
\item one variable: Z HT  / CI for a single proportion
\item two variables: Z HT  / CI  comparing two proportions
\end{itemize} 

\pause

\item Categorical data with more than 2 levels $\rightarrow$ $\chi^2$

\pause

\begin{itemize}
\item one variable: \hl{$\chi^2$ test of goodness of fit}, no CI
\item two variables: \hl{$\chi^2$ test of independence}, no CI
\end{itemize} 

\end{itemize}

\pause

\textbf{If sample size related conditions are not met:} \pause Simulation based inference (randomization for HT / bootstrapping for CI, when appropriate)

We have historical data from lottery outcomes such that we are able to calculate how many times each of the 59 white balls were picked.

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]

\begin{itemize}

\subsection{The $\chi^2$ statistic is always positive and right skewed}
\label{mi2}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{The $\chi^2$ statistic}

\hl{$\chi^2$ statistic:} When dealing with counts and investigating how far the observed counts are from the expected counts, we use a new test statistic called the \hl{chi-square ($\chi^2$) statistic}:
\[\chi^2 = \sum_{i = 1}^k \frac{(O - E)^2}{E} \qquad \text{where $k$ = total number of cells} \]

\textbf{Important points:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Use \textbf{counts} (not \textbf{proportions}) in the calculation of the text statistic, even though we're truly interested in the proportions for inference
\item Expected counts are calculated assuming the null hypothesis is true
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{The $\chi^2$ distribution}

The $\chi^2$ distribution has just one parameter, \hl{degrees of freedom (df)}, which influences the shape, center, and spread of the distribution.
\begin{itemize}
\item For $\chi^2$ GOF test: $df = k - 1$ \\
\item For $\chi^2$ independence test: $df = (R-1) \times (C-1)$ 
\end{itemize}

\item Using R: \texttt{pchisq()}

\item Using the table: works a lot like the $t$ table, but only provides upper tail values.

\label{mi3}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Conditions for $\chi^2$ testing}

\begin{enumerate}

\item \hlGr{Independence:} In addition to what we previously discussed for independence, each case that contributes a count to the table must be independent of all the other cases in the table.

\item \hlGr{Sample size / distribution:} Each cell must have at least 5 \red{expected} cases.

\item How would you identify your socio-economic status: low, middle, high?
\item What type of pet did you have growing up, select all that apply: cat, dog, fish, bird, rodent, none of the above?
\end{itemize}
What test is most appropriate for evaluating the relationship between these two variables?}
