\subsection{Use hypothesis tests to make decisions about population parameters}
\label{mi1}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{1. Use hypothesis tests to make decisions about population parameters}

Hypothesis testing framework:

\begin{enumerate}

\item Set the hypotheses.

\item Check assumptions and conditions.

\item Calculate a \hl{test statistic} and a p-value.

\item Make a decision, and interpret it in context of the research question.

\end{enumerate}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Hypothesis testing for a population mean}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Set the hypotheses
\begin{itemize}
\item $H_0: \mu = null~value$
\item $H_A: \mu <$ or $>$ or $\ne null~value$
\end{itemize}

\pause

\item Check assumptions and conditions
\begin{itemize}
\item Independence: random sample/assignment, 10\% condition when sampling without replacement
\item Sample size / skew: $n \ge 30$ (or larger if sample is skewed), no extreme skew
\end{itemize}

\pause

\item Calculate a \hl{test statistic} and a p-value (draw a picture!)
\[ Z = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu}{SE},~where~SE = \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} \]

\pause

\item Make a decision, and interpret it in context of the research question
\begin{itemize}
\item If p-value $< \alpha$, reject $H_0$, data provide evidence for $H_A$
\item If p-value $> \alpha$, do not reject $H_0$, data do not provide evidence for $H_A$
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}

\item \textcolor{gray}{P-value is the probability that the null hypothesis is true} \\
\textit{A p-value is the probability of getting a sample that results in a test statistic 
as or more extreme than what you actually observed (and in favor of the null hypothesis) 
if in fact the null hypothesis is correct. It is a conditional probability, conditioned on the 
null hypothesis being correct.}

\pause

\item  \textcolor{gray}{A high p-value confirms the null hypothesis.}\\
\textit{A high p-value means the data do not provide convincing evidence for the alternative 
hypothesis and hence that the null hypothesis can't be rejected.} \\

\pause

\item   \textcolor{gray}{A low p-value confirms the alternative hypothesis.} \\
\textit{A low p-value means the data provide convincing evidence for the alternative hypothesis, 
but not necessarily that it is confirmed.} \\
