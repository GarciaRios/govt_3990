It's not feasible to obtain offspring data from on all female lemurs, so we use 
data from the Cornell Lemur Center. We use the sample mean from these data as an

\end{itemize}

\item \alert{Spread}: measure of variability in the distribution (standard deviation, IQR, range, etc.)

\item \alert{Unusual observations}: observations that stand out from the rest of the data that may be suspected outliers

\end{itemize}

%---Note---%
\note{

  Always talk about shape, center, spread, etc.

  Shape

  What do I mean by modality: promenent peaks.

  When talking about center, what is most common measure of center: mean

  What else: median.

  Mode is also used, though it isn't always that useful.  It is the most
  frequent observation.  But it is sometimes hard to determine what that is when
  working with continuous numerical data.

  Just a note for notation: $\mu$ or any greek letter denotes a pop. param.
  $\mu$ is pop bar.

  xbar is a sample statistic.  Often times we want to know mu, but we don't have
  pop, so we caompute xbar and call that best guess.

  how can we put some uncertainty around best guess to refelect that this comes
  from sample and not whole pop.

  when we talk about spread we are talking about variability in the distrbution.

  unusual observations.  sometimes people just remove outliers.  you should not
  do that unless you have good reason to do so, they may convey important information.

\alert{Why do we use the squared deviation in the calculation of variance?}

\pause

\begin{itemize}
\item To get rid of negatives so that observations equally distant from the mean are weighed equally.
\item To weigh larger deviations more heavily.
\end{itemize}

%---Note---%
\note{

why divide by $n-1$ instead of $n$?

go back.  comopare equations.  ideally use population mean.  this introduces
extra uncertatiny.  for that we need to penalize ourselves.

if i divide by $n-1$ or $n$ which yields a higher value?  if i divide by
something smaller, I get a larger number.

so we are in effect reporting a larger estimate of the standard deviation.  this
is conservative.

go forward.  why square things?  what happens if we add a positive and a
negative number?  they cancel out.

one reaons, you don't want poitives and negatives to cancle.

what would be a more intuitive way?

abs.

what does square do?  it weights larger deviations more heavily?
