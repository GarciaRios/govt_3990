In this activity you will read media coverage of a study published in a peer reviewed 
journal, and answer a few of question about a study. It is possible that the article 
doesn't provide the relevant information to answer certain question(s). If so, refer 
to the original study (linked below). You do not need to read the entire paper, in fact, 
you are certainly not expected to understand all of it. Simply find the information that 
will help you answer the questions. \\
