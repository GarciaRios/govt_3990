Let's remove trucks older than 20 years, and only focus on trucks made in 1992 or later.

The linear model doesn't appear to be a good fit since the residuals have non-constant variance.

We applied a log transformation to the response variable. The relationship now seems linear, and the residuals 
no longer have non-constant variance.

\begin{itemize}

\item For each additional year the car is newer (for each year decrease in car's age) we would expect the log 
price of the car to increase on average by 0.137 log dollars.

\item which is not very useful...

\frametitle{Working with logs}

\begin{itemize}

\item Subtraction and logs: $log(a) - log(b) = log(\frac{a}{b})$

\pause

\item Natural logarithm: $e^{log(x)} = x$

\pause

\item We can these identities to ``undo" the log transformation 

\end{itemize}


\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Interpreting models with log transformation (cont.)}

The slope coefficient for the log transformed model is 0.137, meaning the \underline{log} price difference between cars that are one year apart is predicted to be 0.14 log dollars.

\begin{eqnarray*}
\text{log(price at year $x + 1$)} - \text{log(price at year $x$)} &=& 0.137 \\
\pause
log \pr{ \frac{\text{price at year $x + 1$}}{\text{price at year $x$}} } &=& 0.137 \\
\pause
e^{log \pr{ \frac{\text{price at year $x + 1$}}{\text{price at year $x$}} }} &=& e^{0.137} \\
\pause
\frac{\text{price at year $x + 1$}}{\text{price at year $x$}} &=& 1.15
\end{eqnarray*}

\pause

For each additional year the car is newer (for each year decrease in car's age) we would expect the price of the car to increase on average \red{by a factor of 1.15}.

\frametitle{Recap: dealing with non-constant variance}

\begin{itemize}

\item Non-constant variance is one of the most common model violations, however it is usually fixable by transforming the response ($y$) variable

\pause

\item The most common variance stabilizing transform is the log transformation: $log(y)$, especially useful when the response variable is (extremely) right skewed.

\pause

\item When using a log transformation on the response variable the interpretation of the slope changes: \pause
\begin{itemize}
\item For each unit increase in $x$, y is expected on average to decrease/increase by a factor of $e^{b_1}$.
\end{itemize}

\pause

\item Another useful transformation is the square root: $\sqrt{y}$, especially useful when the response variable is counts.

\pause

\item These transformations may also be useful when the relationship is non-linear, but in those cases a polynomial regression may also be needed.

\end{itemize}
