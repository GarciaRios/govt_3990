\[
F = \frac{\sum {\color{blue} \mid}^2 \; \; / \; \; (k - 1)}{\sum {\color{green} \mid}^2 \; \; / \; \; (n - k)}
\hspace{12pt} = \hspace{12pt} \frac{MSG}{MSE}

$k$: \# of groups; $n$: \# of obs.

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{To identify which means are different, use t-tests and the Bonferroni correction}

\begin{itemize}

\item If the ANOVA yields a significant results, next natural question is: ``Which means are different?"

\item Use t-tests comparing each pair of means to each other, 
\begin{itemize}
\item with a common variance ($MSE$ from the ANOVA table) instead of each group's variances in the 
calculation of the standard error,
\item and with a common degrees of freedom ($df_E$ from the ANOVA table)
\end{itemize}

\item Compare resulting p-values to a modified significance level
\[ \alpha^\star = \frac{\alpha}{K} \]
where $K$ is the total number of pairwise tests
