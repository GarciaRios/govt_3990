\subsection{CLT also describes the distribution of $\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2$}
\label{mi1}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{CLT also describes the distribution of $\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2$}

\[ (\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2) \sim N \pr{ mean = (p_1 - p_2), SE = \sqrt{ \frac{p_1(1-p_1)}{n_1} + \frac{p_2(1-p_2)}{n_2} } } \]

Conditions:
\begin{itemize}
\item Independence: Random sample/assignment + 10\% rule
\item Sample size / skew: At least 10 successes and failures
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\subsection{For HT where $H_0: p_1 = p_2$, pool!}
\label{mi2}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{For HT where $H_0: p_1 = p_2$, pool!}

As with working with a single proportion,

\begin{itemize}

\item When doing a HT where $H_0: p_1 = p_2$ (almost always for HT), use expected counts / proportions for S-F condition and calculation of the standard error.

\item Otherwise use observed counts / proportions for S-F condition and calculation of the standard error.

\end{itemize}

\pause 

Expected proportion of success for both groups when $H_0: p_1 = p_2$ is defined as the \hl{pooled proportion}:
\[ \hat{p}_{pool} = \frac{total~successes}{total~sample~size} = \frac{suc_1 + suc_2}{n_1 + n_2} \]

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item $\frac{30}{50}$
\item $\frac{20}{60}$
\item $\frac{30}{50} + \frac{20}{60}$

\subsection{When S-F fails, simulate!}
\label{mi3}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{When S-F fails, simulate!}

\begin{itemize}

\item If the S-F condition is met, can do theoretical inference: Z test, Z interval

\item If the S-F condition is not met, must use simulation based methods: randomization test, bootstrap interval

\end{itemize}

\frametitle{On the perils of living dangerously in the slasher horror film}

{\small \textbf{Abstract:} \textit{The slasher horror film has been deplored based on claims that it depicts eroticized 
violence against predominately female characters as punishment for sexual activities. To test this assertion, a 
quantitative content analysis was conducted to examine the extent to which gender differences are evident in the 
association between character survival and engagement in sexual activities. Information pertaining to gender, 
engagement in sexual activities, and survival was coded for film characters from a simple random sample of 50 
English-language, North American slasher films released between 1960 and 2009.}}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Use 263 index cards, where each card represents a male character in a slasher film in the sample.

\pause

\item Mark 35 of the cards as ``survival" and the remaining 228 as ``death".

\pause

\item Shuffle the cards and split into two groups of size 74 and 189, for sexual activity present and absent,
respectively.

\pause

\item Calculate the difference between the proportions of ``survival" in the sexual activity present and absent
groups.

\pause

\item Repeat steps (3) and (4) many times to build a randomization distribution of differences in simulated proportions.
