The goal of this lab is to introduce you to R and RStudio, which you'll be using
throughout the course both to learn the statistical concepts discussed in the 
texbook and also to analyze real data and come to informed conclusions.  To 
straighten out which is which: R is the name of the programming language itself 
and RStudio is a convenient interface.

As the labs progress, you are encouraged to explore beyond what the labs dictate;
a willingness to experiment will make you a much better programmer.  Before we 
get to that stage, however, you need to build some basic fluency in R.  Today we
begin with the fundamental building blocks of R and RStudio: the interface, 
reading in data, and basic commands.

![rinterface](rInterface2014.png)

The panel in the upper right contains your *workspace* as well as a history of 
the commands that you've previously entered.  Any plots that you generate will 
show up in the panel in the lower right corner.

The panel on the left is where the action happens.  It's called the *console*. 
Everytime you launch RStudio, it will have the same text at the top of the 
console telling you the version of R that you're running.  Below that information
is the *prompt*.  As its name suggests, this prompt is really a request, a 
request for a command.  Initially, interacting with R is all about typing commands
and interpreting the output. These commands and their syntax have evolved over
decades (literally) and now provide what many users feel is a fairly natural way
to access data and organize, describe, and invoke statistical computations.

## Creating a reproducible lab report

We will be using a markdown language, R Markdown, to type up the lab report. This 
allows you to complete your lab entirely in RStudio as well as ensuring 
reproducibility of your analysis and results. To help get you started we are 
providing a template for you. Use the following code to download this template:

```{r load-template, eval=FALSE}
download("http://stat.duke.edu/courses/Fall15/sta101.002/rmd/lab1.Rmd", destfile = "lab1.Rmd")
```

You will see a new file called `lab1.Rmd` in the Files tab on the pane in the 
bottom right corner of your RStudio window. We will refer to this as your "R 
markdown file" or "your report". Click on the file name to open the file. All you 
need to do to complete the lab is to type up your **brief** answers and the R 
code (when necessary) in the spaces provided in the document. Earlier in the lab 
spaces are provided for you to enter R code chunks. Later in the lab you'll need 
to figure out whether code is needed to answer a particular question, and if so a 
new chunk can be inserted by clicking on the *Insert Chunk* button (dropdown menu 
under *Chunks* on the upper right corner of your markdown document).

Before you keep going type your team name, the name of the team member who is the 
"author" for the day, and the "discussants", who are the other team members 
present in lab today. Then click on *Knit HTML* and you'll see your document in a 
new pop-up window.

## The Data: Dr. Arbuthnot's Baptism Records

To get you started, run the following command from your markdown file.

```{r load-abrbuthnot-data, eval=TRUE, message = FALSE}
source("http://www.openintro.org/stat/data/arbuthnot.R")
```

To do so, you can simply put your cursor on that line, and hit the **Run** button
on the upper right corner of the pane.

This command instructs R to load some data: 
the Arbuthnot baptism counts for boys and girls. You should see that the 
workspace area in the upper righthand corner of the RStudio window now lists a 
data set called `arbuthnot` that has 82 observations on 3 variables. As you 
interact with R, you will create a series of objects. Sometimes you load them as
we have done here, and sometimes you create them yourself as the byproduct of a 
computation or some analysis you have performed.

The Arbuthnot data set refers to Dr. John Arbuthnot, an 18<sup>th</sup> century 
physician, writer, and mathematician.  He was interested in the ratio of newborn
boys to newborn girls, so he gathered the baptism records for children born in
London for every year from 1629 to 1710.  We can take a look at the data by 
typing its name into the console.

```{r view-data, eval=FALSE}
arbuthnot
```

What you should see are four columns of numbers, each row representing a 
different year: the first entry in each row is simply the row number (an index 
we can use to access the data from individual years if we want), the second is 
the year, and the third and fourth are the numbers of boys and girls baptized 
that year, respectively. Use the scrollbar on the right side of the console 
window to examine the complete data set.

Note that the row numbers in the first column are not part of Arbuthnot's data. 
R adds them as part of its printout to help you make visual comparisons. You can
think of them as the index that you see on the left side of a spreadsheet. In 
fact, the comparison to a spreadsheet will generally be helpful. R has stored 
Arbuthnot's data in a kind of spreadsheet or table called a *data frame*.

You can see the dimensions of this data frame by typing:

```{r dim-data, eval=TRUE}
dim(arbuthnot)
```

This command should output `[1] 82 3`, indicating that there are 82 rows and 3 
columns (we'll get to what the `[1]` means in a bit), just as it says next to 
the object in your workspace. You can see the names of these columns (or 
variables) by typing:

```{r names-data, eval=TRUE}
names(arbuthnot)
```

You should see that the data frame contains the columns `year`,  `boys`, and 
`girls`. At this point, you might notice that many of the commands in R look a 
lot like functions from math class; that is, invoking R commands means supplying
a function with some number of arguments. The `dim` and `names` commands, for 
example, each took a single argument, the name of a data frame. 

One advantage of RStudio is that it comes with a built-in data viewer. Click on
the name `arbuthnot` in the *Environment* pane (upper right window) that lists 
the objects in your workspace. This will bring up an alternative display of the 
data set in the *Data Viewer* (upper left window). You can close the data viewer
by clicking on the *x* in the upper lefthand corner.

## Some Exploration

Let's start to examine the data a little more closely. We can access the data in
a single column of a data frame separately using a command like

```{r view-boys, eval=FALSE}
arbuthnot$boys
```

This command will only show the number of boys baptized each year.

1.  What command would you use to extract just the counts of girls baptized? Try
    it! (Enter your answer in your R markdown document and run the entire report
    by hitting **Knit HTML**. Voila! The R outout you need is already in your 
    report.)
    
Notice that the way R has printed these data is different. When we looked at the
complete data frame, we saw 82 rows, one on each line of the display. These data
are no longer structured in a table with other variables, so they are displayed 
one right after another. Objects that print out in this way are called vectors; 
they represent a set of numbers. R has added numbers in [brackets] along the left
side of the printout to indicate locations within the vector. For example, 5218 
follows [1], indicating that 5218 is the first entry in the vector. And if [43] 
starts a line, then that would mean the first number on that line would represent
the 43rd entry in the vector.

R has some powerful functions for making graphics. We can create a simple plot 
of the number of girls baptized per year with the command

```{r plot-girls-vs-year, eval=FALSE}
qplot(x = year, y = girls, data = arbuthnot)
```

The `qplot()` function (meaning "quick plot") looks at the type of data you have
provided it and makes the decision to visualize it with a scatterplot. The plot
should appear under the *Plots* tab of the lower right panel of RStudio. Notice 
that the command above again looks like a function, this time with three arguments
separated by commas.  The first two arguments in the `qplot()` function specify 
the variables for the x-axis and the y-axis and the third provides the name of the
data set where they can be found. If we wanted to connect the data points with 
lines, we could add a fourth argument to specify the geometry that we'd like.

```{r plot-girls-vs-year-line, eval=FALSE}
qplot(x = year, y = girls, data = arbuthnot, geom = "line")
```

You might wonder how you are supposed to know that it was possible to add that 
fourth argument.  Thankfully, R documents all of its functions extensively. To 
read what a function does and learn the arguments that are available to you, 
just type in a question mark followed by the name of the function that you're 
interested in. Try the following.

```{r plot-help, eval=FALSE, tidy = FALSE}
?qplot
```

Notice that the help file replaces the plot in the lower right panel. You can 
toggle between plots and help files using the tabs at the top of that panel.

2.  Is there an apparent trend in the number of girls baptized over the years? 
How would you describe it?

Now, suppose we want to plot the total number of baptisms.  To compute this, we 
could use the fact that R is really just a big calculator. We can type in 
mathematical expressions like

```{r calc-total-bapt-numbers, eval=FALSE}
5218 + 4683
```

to see the total number of baptisms in 1629. We could repeat this once for each 
year, but there is a faster way. If we add the vector for baptisms for boys to 
that of girls, R will compute all sums simultaneously.

```{r calc-total-bapt-vars, eval=FALSE}
arbuthnot$boys + arbuthnot$girls
```

What you will see are 82 numbers (in that packed display, because we arenâ€™t 
looking at a data frame here), each one representing the sum weâ€™re after. Take a
look at a few of them and verify that they are right.

We'll be using this new vector to generate some plots, so we'll want to save it 
as a permanent column in our data frame.

```{r calc-total-bapt-vars-save, eval=FALSE}
arbuthnot <- mutate(arbuthnot, total = boys + girls)
```

You'll see that there is now a new column called "total" that has been tacked on
to the data frame. The special symbol `<-` performs an *assignment*, taking the 
output of one line of code and saving it into an object in your workspace. In 
this case, you already have an object called `arbuthnot`, so this command updates
that data set with the new mutated column.

We can make a plot of the total number of baptisms per year with the command

```{r plot-total-vs-year, eval=FALSE}
qplot(x = year, y = total, data = arbuthnot, geom = "line")
```

Similarly to how we computed the total number of births, we can compute the ratio 
of the number of boys to the number of girls baptized in 1629 with

```{r calc-prop-boys-to-girls-numbers, eval=FALSE}
5218 / 4683
```

or we can act on the complete columns with the expression

```{r calc-prop-boys-to-girls-vars, eval=FALSE}
arbuthnot$boys / arbuthnot$girls
```

We can also compute the proportion of newborns that are boys

```{r calc-prop-boys-numbers, eval=FALSE}
5218 / (5218 + 4683)
```

or this may also be computed for all years simultaneously:

```{r calc-prop-boys-vars, eval=FALSE}
arbuthnot$boys / (arbuthnot$boys + arbuthnot$girls)
```

Note that with R as with your calculator, you need to be conscious of the order 
of operations.  Here, we want to divide the number of boys by the total number 
of newborns, so we have to use parentheses.  Without them, R will first do the 
division, then the addition, giving you something that is not a proportion.

3.  Now, *mutate* the data frame once more to include a new column for the 
proportion of newborns that are boys, then generate a plot of that proportion 
over time. What do you see? Tip: If you use the up and down arrow keys, you can 
scroll through your previous commands, your so-called command history. You can 
also access it by clicking on the history tab in the upper right panel.  This 
will save you a lot of typing in the future.

Finally, in addition to simple mathematical operators like subtraction and 
division, you can ask R to make comparisons like greater than, `>`, less than,
`<`, and equality, `==`. For example, we can ask if boys outnumber girls in each 
year with the expression

```{r boys-more-than-girls, eval=FALSE}
arbuthnot$boys > arbuthnot$girls
```

This command returns 82 values of either `TRUE` if that year had more boys
than girls, or `FALSE` if that year did not (the answer may surprise you). This 
output shows a different kind of data than we have considered so far. All other
columns in the `arbuthnot` data frame have values are numerical (the year, the 
number of boys and girls). Here, we've asked R to create *logical* data, data 
where the values are either `TRUE` or `FALSE`. In general, data analysis will 
involve many different kinds of data types, and one reason for using R is that 
it is able to represent and compute with many of them.

This seems like a fair bit for your first lab, so let's stop here. To exit 
RStudio you can click on the log out link at the upper right corner of the screen.
Go ahead and log out and then sign back in. You'll find your R session is just
as you left it.

## On Your Own

In the previous few pages, you recreated some of the displays and preliminary 
analysis of Arbuthnot's baptism data. Your assignment involves repeating these 
steps, but for present day birth records in the United States.  Load up the 
present day data with the following command.

```{r load-present-data, eval=FALSE}
source("http://www.openintro.org/stat/data/present.R")
```

The data are stored in a data frame called `present`.

-   What years are included in this data set? What are the dimensions of the 
    data frame and what are the variable or column names?

-   How do these counts compare to Arbuthnot's? Are they on a similar scale?

-   Make a plot that displays the proportion of boys for every year in the data 
    set. What do you see? Does Arbuthnot's observation about boys being born in
    greater proportion than girls hold up in the U.S.? Include the plot in your 
    response.

-   In what year did we see the most total number of births in the U.S.?

These data come from a report by the Centers for Disease Control 
[http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr53/nvsr53_20.pdf](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr53/nvsr53_20.pdf).

birth in the United States.

That was a short introduction to R and RStudio, but we will provide you with more
functions and a more complete sense of the language as the course progresses. 
Feel free to browse around the websites for [R](http://www.r-project.org) and
