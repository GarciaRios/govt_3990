### Course goals & objectives:

This course introduces students to the discipline of statistics as a science of understanding and analyzing data. Throughout the semester, students will learn how to effectively make use of data in the face of uncertainty: how to collect data, how to analyze data, and how to use data to make inferences and conclusions about real world phenomena.

The course goals are as follows:

1. Recognize the importance of data collection, identify limitations in data collection methods, and determine how they affect the scope of inference.
2. Use statistical software to summarize data numerically and visually, and to perform data analysis.
3. Have a conceptual understanding of the unified nature of statistical inference.
4. Apply estimation and testing methods to analyze single variables or the relationship between two variables in order to understand natural phenomena and make data-based decisions.
5. Model numerical response variables using a single or multiple explanatory variables.
6. Interpret results correctly, effectively, and in context without relying on statistical jargon.
7. Critique data-based claims and evaluate data-based decisions.
8. Complete two research projects: one that focuses on statistical inference and one that focuses on modeling.

### Tips for success:

* Complete the reading before a new unit begins, and then review again after the unit is over.
* Be an active participant during lectures and labs.
* Ask questions - during class or office hours, or by email. Ask me, your TAs, and your classmates.
* Do the problem sets - start early and make sure you attempt and understand all questions.
* Start your projects early and and allow adequate time to complete them.
* Give yourself plenty of time time to prepare a good cheat sheet for exams. This requires going through the material and taking the time to review the concepts that you're not comfortable with.
* Do not procrastinate - don't let a unit go by with unanswered questions as it will just make the following unit's material even more difficult to follow. 

* * *

### Course structure:

The course is divided into seven learning units. For each unit a set of learning objectives and required and suggested readings, videos, etc. will be posted on the course website. You are expected to watch the videos and/or complete the readings and familiarize yourselves with the learning objectives. We will begin the unit with a readiness assessment: 10 multiple choice questions that you answer using your clickers in class. You will then re-take this assessment in teams. The rest of the class time will be split between discussion of the material and application exercises that you'll complete in teams. Slides and other relevant materials for each class and lab will be available on the [calendar](../Calendar/calendar.) page before each class. Videos and other relevant prep materials for each unit are also available on that page. Within each unit you will complement your learning with problem sets and labs, and wrap up each unit with a performance assessment.

* * *

### Videos:

All videos and learning objectives as well as learning supplementary materials that you will need for preparing for the readiness assessments are hosted on the Blackboard page for this course.

</table>
</div>

Grades may be curved at the end of the semester. Cumulative numerical averages of 90 - 100 are guaranteed at least an A-, 80 - 89 at least a B-, and 70 - 79 at least a C-, however the exact ranges for letter grades will be determined after the final exam. The more evidence there is that the class has mastered the material, the more generous the curve will be.

* * *

### Work load:

You are expected to put in about 4-6 hours of work / week outside of class. Some of you will do well with less time than this, and some of you will need more.

* * *

### Teams:

To construct highly functional teams of learners, you are asked to complete a short survey as well as a pre-test to gauge your previous exposure to statistics and statistical literacy. If you haven't yet done so please complete these items as soon as possible. 

You will be assigned to teams of 3-5 students based on the results of the survey and the pre-test. Once team assignments have been made there is no option for changing teams, other than under extraordinary circumstances. You will work in these teams during application exercises and team portions of the readiness assessments. In addition, your team members will be your first point of contact in this class.

You are encouraged to study with your team members and other classmates. But remember that anything that is not explicitly a team assignment must be your own work. 

* * *

### Clickers:

Throughout the lectures you will use clickers to both answer conceptual questions and for data collection/class surveys. In order to receive credit for the clicker questions you must register your clicker [here](http://iclicker.com/support/registeryourclicker). In the Student ID field enter your Net ID, and in the Remote ID field enter the alphanumeric code printed below the barcode on the back of your clicker. 

These questions are on material introduced in class that day, and you get credit for clicking in, regardless of whether you have the correct answer. To get credit for the day you must respond to at least 75% of the questions. The objective of these questions is to help make you an active participant and gauge the class' mastery of the material. Participation data from clickers will become a part of your attendance/participation grade.

You are required to bring your clicker to every lecture and it is your responsibility to show up to class on time. Most importantly, it is your responsibility to come to class. I realize that occasionally you may be late, forget your clicker, or need to miss class. *Up to three* unexcused late arrivals or absences will not affect your clicker grade. If one person is simultaneously using two or more clickers, then all owners of the clickers will receive a 0 for an overall clicker grade, and will be reported to the [Office of Student Conduct]().

* * *

### Attendance, participation, and peer evaluation:

You are expected to be present at class meeting and actively participate in the discussion. Your attendance and participation during class, as well as your activity on the discussion forum on Sakai will make up a non-insignificant portion of your grade in this class. While I might sometimes call on you during the class discussion, it is your responsibility to be an active participant without being called on. 

Throughout the semester you will also be asked to complete a few peer evaluations. These will be used to ensure that all team members contribute to the success of the group and to address any potential issues early on. If you feel that there are issues within your team, you are encouraged to discuss it with your team members and to bring it to my or your TA's attention. 

* * *

### Problem sets:

These will be assigned (approximately) weekly on the course webpage and will be comprised of problems from the textbook. Each assignment will list roughly five to seven problems from the book to be turned in for grading, and roughly 10 practice problems. You do not need to turn in the practice problems, and the solutions can be found in the back of the book.

The objective of the problem sets is to help you develop a more in-depth understanding of the material and help you prepare for exams and projects. Grading will be based on completeness as well as accuracy. In order to receive credit you must show all your work.

You are welcomed, and encouraged, to work with each other on the problems, but you must turn in your own work. If you copy someone else's work, both parties will receive a 0 for the problem set grade as well as being reported to the [Office of Student Conduct](). Work submitted on Sakai will be checked for instances of plagiarism prior to being graded.

**Submission instructions:** You will turn in your problem sets on Balckboard. We strongly recommend working in a word processor of your choice, saving your work as PDF, and submitting that. You are welcomed to submit as Word files as well, however if we cannot open your file you will receive a 0 on the problem set (so it may not be worth taking that risk!). Alternatively you can type your answers in the text box in Sakai however if you lose internet connection and you haven’t saved you might lose your work (so if you’ll use this approach make sure to save often!).

All assignments will be time stamped and late work will be penalized based on this time stamp (see late work policy below).

*Lowest score will be dropped.*

* * *

### Labs:

The objective of the labs is to give you hands on experience with data analysis using modern statistical software. The labs will also provide you with tools that you will need to complete the projects successfully. We will use a statistical analysis package called RStudio, which is a front end for the R statistical language.

In class your TAs will give a brief overview of the lab and learning goals, and guide you through some of the exercises. You will start working on the lab during the class session, but note that the labs are designed to take more than just the class time, so you will meet up with your team at a later time to finish the lab before the due date (which will be the following lab session). In order to get credit for a lab report, you must be in the lab session on the day that lab is introduced.

**Submission instructions:** Always submit the Rmd and the HTML files for your lab. One submission per team.

*Lowest score will be dropped.*

* * *

### Readiness assessments:

Readiness assessments will be given at the beginning of a unit. These are 10 question multiple choice assessments comprised of conceptual questions addressing the learning objectives of the new unit. You are not expected to master all topics in the unit ahead of time, but you are responsible for completing the reading assignment, understanding how the material fits in the greater framework of the course, and acquire a conceptual understanding of the learning objectives. As described above, you will first take the individual readiness assessment using your clickers, and then re-take the same assessment in teams using scratch off sheets. Your performance on both assessments will factor into your final grade (3/4 individual score, 1/4 team score). In addition, your input during the team portion will factor into your participation grade.

*Lowest score will be dropped.*

* * *

### Performance assessments:

Performance assessments will be given at the end of a unit. These are very similar to the readiness assessments in format, however you will be taking them outside of class on Sakai. Outstanding performance will require mastery of all topics in the unit. 

*Lowest score will be dropped.*

* * *

### Projects:

The objective of the projects is to give you independent applied research experience using real data and statistical methods. Both projects will be completed in teams.

* Project 1: For a parameter of interest to you, you will describe the relevant data, compute a confidence interval and conduct a hypothesis test,  and summarize your findings in a written, fully reproducible, data analysis report. 
* Project 2: You will use all (relevant) techniques learned in this class to analyze a dataset provided by me, and share your results in a poster session.

Further details on the projects will be provided as due dates approach.

Note that you **must complete both projects and score at least 30% of total possible points on each project in order to pass this class**.

* * *

### Exams:

There will be two midterms and one final in this class. See [course info](/info/#exams) for dates and times of the exams. Exam dates cannot be changed and no make-up exams will be given. If you can't take the exams on these dates you should drop this class. You can't pass the class if you do not take the final exam. 
You are allowed to use one sheet of notes ("cheat sheet") to the midterm and the final. This sheet must be no larger than 8 1/2 x 11, and **must be prepared by you**. You may use both sides of the sheet.
