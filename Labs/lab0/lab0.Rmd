### (1) Familiarize yourself with the course website

The course website is at `r course_website`. This is where all course materials
will be posted.

### (2) Get RStudio

You will be using R and RStudio throughout the course both to learn the 
statistical concepts discussed in the texbook and also to analyze real data 
and come to informed conclusions.  To straighten out which is which: R is the 
name of the programming language itself and RStudio is a convenient interface.


The RStudio window should look something like this:

![](rInterface2015.png)



The panel in the upper right contains your *workspace* as well as a history of 
the commands that you've previously entered.  Any plots that you generate will 
show up in the panel in the lower right corner.

The panel on the left is where the action happens.  It's called the *console*.  
Everytime you launch RStudio, it will have the same text at the top of the 
console telling you the version of R that you're running.  Below that 
information is the *prompt*.  As its name suggests, this prompt is really a 
request, a request for a command.  Initially, interacting with R is all about 
typing commands and interpreting the output. These commands and their syntax 
have evolved over decades (literally) and now provide what many users feel is a 
fairly natural way to access data and organize, describe, and invoke 
statistical computations.

You can use R as a calculator. To get you started, enter the following command 
at the R prompt (i.e. right after `>` on the console).  You can either type it 
in manually or copy and paste it from this document.

```{r}
2+2
```

And you can save this result to an object that you can access later

```{r}
x = 2+2
```

Try typing `x` in the console to verify that. 

You can also see this new object in your environment on the upper right pane. 
Next time you log on to RStudio the object will still be here.

Throughout the semester you will learn about how to use R to do data analysis, 
and in the meantime you will be exposed to some programming. In addition, you 
will learn best practices for saving your code and making sure that your 
analysis is reproducible.



### (3) Pre-test

Dowload and print the [Course Assement](./Govt_3990_Course_Assessment.pdf). Try your best, but donâ€™t worry about it if the questions are unfamiliar to you. This information will only be used to adjust the course accordingly.
