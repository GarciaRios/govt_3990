\subsection{Disjoint and independent do not mean the same thing}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{1. Disjoint and independent do not mean the same thing}

\begin{itemize}

\item \hl{Disjoint (mutually exclusive) events} cannot happen at the same time
\begin{itemize}
\item A voter cannot register as a Democrat and a Republican at the same time
\item But they might be a Republican and a Moderate at the same time -- 
\hl{non-disjoint events}
\item For disjoint A and B: $P(A~and~B) = 0$
\end{itemize}

\pause

\item If A and B are \hl{independent events}, having information on A does 
not tell us anything about B (and vice versa)
\begin{itemize}
\item If A and B are independent: 
\begin{itemize}
\item $P(A~|~B) = P(A)$
\item $P(A~and~B) = P(A) \times P(B)$
\end{itemize}
